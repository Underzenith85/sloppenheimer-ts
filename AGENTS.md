# Repository Structure

Symphony is intended to be a private pnpm workspace with these architectural package boundaries:

- `packages/core` contains domain types, ports, and orchestration policy. It must not depend on
  concrete adapters.
- `packages/adapter-github` contains the GitHub tracker and code-review implementations.
- `packages/adapter-codex` contains the Codex agent-runner implementation.
- The root application is the composition root for the CLI, operator server, configuration, and the
  single Symphony executable.

Package manifests must encode the dependency direction so that `packages/core` cannot import either
adapter package. These packages are architectural units, not independently published products. They
remain private and share one lockfile, CI pipeline, versioning policy, and deployable Symphony
executable.

Issues #84 and #86 establish the source layout and import rules first. Issue #109 then performs the
package migration without reopening those boundaries. If that migration is too large for one safe
pull request, split it into independently buildable steps; do not land a half-migrated workspace.
